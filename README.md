Fluent full stack developer.

Languages: C++, Java, C#, C (kinda), TypeScript (Kinda), JavaScript

API's/Libraries: Java ASM, OpenGL (learning), Vulkan (Learning)

I'm learning a lot more than this list and doing way more projects than that, but that's all I can think of for now.

Currently Learning:
1. Cryptography more specifically AES, RSA, ECC,
2. AOT and JIT compilers,
3. CPU Architectures,
4. 2D and 3D Rendering,
5. UDP, TCP, IPV4, IPV6 sockets,
6. Bytecode/IL,
7. Transpilers,
8. logistic regression neural network models,
9. generative adversarial neural network (GAN) models
10. Rust, HTML, CSS, D Lang (maybe)
11. IOCTL communication between kernel and usermode

Main Learning Focuses:
1. C++ Reverse Engineering
2. x86 assembly
3. Windows Kernel 

Current Projects:
1. Socket communication between C++ and Java
2. OpenGL Rendering Library
3. Asynchronous & Synchronous EventBus
4. Encrypted IRC (Internet Relay Chat) communcation
5. Custom OOP JIT based language with custom compiler written in C and a native function interface similar to the JNI (almost done actually)
6. Java Obfuscator
7. Secure Encrypted and Hashed Authentication
8. Custom assymetric & symmetric encryption algorithm
9. AES file encryption for executables, images, etc
